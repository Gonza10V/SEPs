## Abstract

This SEP proposes a ComponentReference object that allows a ComponentInstance to be referenced through children, rather than requiring it to be imported as an immediate child of the containing ComponentDefinition or ModuleDefinition.  A new ComponentEquivalence class then takes advantage of this to eliminate the need for MapsTo when linking equivalent components.

## Motivation <a name='motivation'></a>

In the current model, a ComponentDefinition or ModuleDefinition that wants to reference an ComponentInstance inside one of its children must import a copy from the child and link the two of them together with a MapsTo.  This is problematic in at least two ways:

1. This creates extra "duplicate" ComponentInstance objects that are confusing and offer extra opportunities for contradictory information to be added.
2. A MapsTo can only reach one level deep, so in order to refer more than one layer, the child definition must be modified as well.

This comes up in two cases: Interactions (in particular, the participant property of Participation), and linking equivalent objects via MapsTo (e.g., when instantiating an abstract component).

This figure shows example of one-layer being required in order to instantiate a genetic production relationship from a CDS in a constitutive expression construct, in which both a MapsTo and a FunctionalComponent must be created:

Here is an example of a two-layer reference, in which two MapsTo objects and two FunctionalComponents must be created, problematically requiring modification to the I13504 object:

Similar problems occur when linking equivalent objects via MapsTo, as shown in this figure:

## Specification <a name='specification'></a>

### ComponentReference

A `ComponentReference` object provides access to `ComponentInstance` objects that are contained within the children of a `ComponentDefinition` or `ModuleDefinition`.  Its fields are:

- `inChildOf`[1] : URI for a `ComponentInstance`
- `componentInstance`[0..1] : URI for a `ComponentInstance`
- `componentReference`[0..1] : URI for a `ComponentReference`

The validation rules are:
- inChildOf must refer to a ComponentInstance pointed directly to by the parent of the ComponentReference (i.e., as a component or ComponentDefinition, a functionalComponent of ModuleDefinition, or an inChildOf of ComponentReference)
- Preciselty one of `componentInstance` and `componentReference` must be defined.
- If `componentInstance` is defined, then it must be a child of the `ComponentInstance` pointed to by `inChildOf`

Examples of using `ComponentReference`:

### ComponentEquivalence

A `ComponentEquivalence ` object allows for linking of `ComponentInstance` objects that refer to the "same" part of a design.  Its fields are:

- `refinement`[1] : URI, either `sbol#verifyIdentical` or `sbol#merge` (from Table 7, `MapsTo` refinements)
- `component`[0..n] : URI for a `ComponentInstanceOrReference` (see below)

The set of objects in the `component` field are treated just like they were all linked pairwise by `MapsTo` `local` and `remote` properties.

Example of using `ComponentEquivalence`:

### Adjusted fields for ComponentDefinition, ModuleDefinition, and Participation

Everywhere that we can currently refer to a `ComponentInstance`, we adjust to instead refer to either a `ComponentInstance` or a `ComponentReference`.  This can be done in one of two ways:

1. Create a "union" superclass, `ComponentInstanceOrReference` that covers both `ComponentInstance` and `ComponentReference`.
2. Wherever we can refer to a `ComponentInstance`, create a second field that can refer to a `ComponentReference` instead.

The first is recommended as the approach to be adopted, as an "empty" union class is not particularly problematic, yet will make reasoning about cardinalities much simpler.

### Deprecation of MapsTo

The `MapsTo` class is made obsolete by `ComponentReference` and `ComponentEquivalence`. as nearly every `MapsTo` relationship can be transformed into an equivalent set of `ComponentReference` and `ComponentEquivalence` relationships.

The only exceptions are `MapsTo` objects that use the `useRemote` or `useLocal` values, since they are asymmetric, and `ComponentEquivalence` is not.  Since these are rarely used, however, their loss is not anticipated to be a problem.

As such, `MapsTo` is deprecated, for removal in SBOL 3.

## Backwards Compatibility <a name='compatibility'></a>

The immediate changes proposed by this SEP are all backward compatible, as they only add material and do not take anything away.   During a transition to use of `ComponentReference`, dual values for `MapsTo` can be generated as needed.

When SBOL 3 is adopted, `MapsTo` will be removed, which is obviously not backward compatible.
