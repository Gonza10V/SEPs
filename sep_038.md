## Abstract

This SEP proposes to modify the relationship between Identified objects and URIs to simplify name management and to disentangle object identity from knowledge graph versioning.

## Motivation <a name='motivation'></a>

URIs in SBOL 2 have several problems:
- URIs are too unconstrained, yet compliance is confusing
- Version location in URIs cause trouble with RDF tooling
- URI-suffix versioning is too granular (at object level, when changes are often made across many objects in a design) but also too contagious (changing an object version requires making duplicate copies of everything that points to it as well).
- URI "flattening" is encouraged (e.g., in the current implementation of SynBioHub), which makes name conflicts more difficult to avoid.


## Specification <a name='specification'></a>

### Identified

Remove the `persistentIdentity` and `version` fields.

### NameSpace

The new `NameSpace` object makes a space of disjoint prefixes explicit.  This object has two fields:

- `identity`[1]: URI for the object.  MUST NOT match any other known NameSpace `[identity]/*`
- `members` [0..n]: optional links to all known TopLevel objects in the name-space.  All linked objects must have a URI prefix matching that of the NameSpace.

Membership of objects in a NameSpace is recommended but not required.

### Required URI Structure

Required identity URI structure: 

- TopLevel: `[namespace]/[local]/[displayId]`
	May not match any other `[TopLevel]/*`
- Child: `[parent]/[displayId]`
	Multiple layers of Child objects are allowed.

In all cases, `displayId` cannot contain `#`,`:`, or `/`

### Recommended ("Compliant") URI Structure

- TopLevel: `[namespace]/[root]/[version]/[collection structure]/[displayId]`
  - Where `[root]` and `[collection structure]` can have multiple layers.
  - This lets `[version]` unite a collection-wide snapshot/diff (not all tuples need to literally stored for effective access)
  - Domain remapping rules: change only `[namespace]/[root]`
- Child: `[TopLevel]/[ChildType][ChildCounter]`
  - (e.g., `[TopLevel]/SequenceAnnotation37`)
  - A new child gets max(`ChildCounter` for `TopLevel` object)+1
  - Note that this is across all types, so you cannot have both `SequenceAnnotation37` and `SequenceConstraint37`.


## Backwards Compatibility <a name='compatibility'></a>

Identified objects under the proposed change will have field values and URIs legal under SBOL 2 as well. URIs will not be compliant, but can be transformed into complian URIs by adding '/1' for version 1.

SBOL 2 Identified objects can be converted to match SBOL 3 requirements by discarding their persistentIdentity and version fields.  Compliant URIs can be converted by using `persistentIdentity` for version 1 objects.  Objects with other versions are extremely rare and could be handled in one of two ways:

- Append the version into the name (e.g., "`-version-`[version]"), probably giving a warning of potential conflict.
- Throw a conversion exception and request that the user rename and reversion manually.

NameSpace objects are new, and thus have no backwards compatibility issue.
