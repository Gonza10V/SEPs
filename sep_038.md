## Abstract

This SEP proposes to modify the relationship between Identified objects and URIs to simplify name management and to disentangle object identity from knowledge graph versioning.

## Motivation <a name='motivation'></a>

URIs in SBOL 2 have several problems:

- URIs are too unconstrained, yet compliance is confusing
- Version location in URIs causes trouble with RDF tooling
- URI-suffix versioning is too granular (at object level, when changes are often made across many objects in a design) but also too contagious (changing an object version requires making duplicate copies of everything that points to it as well).
- URI "flattening" is encouraged (e.g., in the current implementation of SynBioHub), which makes name conflicts more difficult to avoid.


## Specification <a name='specification'></a>

### Identified

Remove the `persistentIdentity` and `version` fields.

### NameSpace

The new `NameSpace` object makes a space of disjoint prefixes explicit.  This object has two fields:

- `identity`[1]: URI for the object.  MUST NOT match any other known NameSpace `[identity]/*`
- `members` [0..n]: optional links to all known TopLevel objects in the name-space.  All linked objects must have a URI prefix matching that of the NameSpace.

Membership of objects in a `NameSpace` is recommended but not required.

### Required URI Structure

Required identity URI structure: 

- TopLevel: `[namespace]/[local]/[displayId]`
	May not match any other `[TopLevel]/*`
- Child: `[parent]/[displayId]`
	Multiple layers of Child objects are allowed.

Since `displayId` values are restricted to alphanumeric and underscores, they will never include delimiters such as '#', ':', and '/'."


### Recommended ("Compliant") URI Structure

- TopLevel: `[domain]/[root]/[collection structure]/[displayId]`
  - where `[namespace]` = `[domain]/[root]`
  - The `[root]` and `[collection structure]` blocks can have multiple layers.
  - Note that this means TopLevel URI structure can always be automatically decomposed with the aid of a NameSpace:
    - Example: "https://synbiohub.org/igem/2017_distribution/promoters/constitutive/BBa_J23101" might have namespace "https://synbiohub.org/igem/2017_distribution", implying domain="https://synbiohub.org", root = "igem/2017_distribution", collection = "promoters/constitutive" and displayId = "BBa_J23101"
  - Domain remapping rules change only `[namespace]`
- Child: `[parent]/[ChildType][ChildTypeCounter]`
  - (e.g., `[parent]/SequenceAnnotation37`)
  - A new child gets max(`ChildTypeCounter` for class in `parent` object)+1
  - Note that numbering is independent for each type, so you _can_ have both `SubComponent37` and `SequenceConstraint37`.


Approaches to versioning are explicitly not specified, being left for experimentation across different tools. This allows version information to be included in the root (e.g., GitHub style: "igem/HEAD/"), collection structure (e.g., "promoters/constitutive/2/"), in tool-specific conventions on displayId (e.g., "BBa_J23101_v2") or in information outside of the URI (e.g., by attaching custom version properties).

## Backwards Compatibility <a name='compatibility'></a>

Identified objects under the proposed change will have field values and URIs legal under SBOL 2 as well. URIs will not be compliant, but can be transformed into compliant URIs by adding '/1' for version 1.

SBOL 2 Identified objects can be converted to match SBOL 3 requirements by discarding their persistentIdentity and version fields.  Compliant URIs can be converted by using `persistentIdentity` for version 1 objects. Objects with other versions are extremely rare and could be handled in one of two ways:

- Append the version into the name (e.g., "`-version-`[version]"), probably giving a warning of potential conflict.
- Throw a conversion exception and request that the user rename and reversion manually.

NameSpace objects are new, and thus have no backwards compatibility issue.

## Discussion <a name='discussion'></a>

Version information was originally proposed to be part of the compliant URI structure, but has been dropped as being constraining on the experimentation with versioning that this SEP aims to enable in tooling.

## Competing SEPs <a name='competing_seps'></a>

None.
