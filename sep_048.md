Abstract
-----------
In SBOL3, combinatorial derivations can also represent things like the design of an experiment, e.g., test strains A, B, and C in media X, Y, and Z.
Currently, however, it is not able to take advantage of the full succinctness offered by the new Feature class.
This SEP proposes a generalization of the CombinatorialDerivation class to allow direct use of all features and measures.

## 1. Rationale <a name="rationale"></a>
----------------
In SBOL3, combinatorial derivations can also represent things like the design of an experiment, e.g., test strains A, B, and C in media X, Y, and Z.

Currently, however, it is not able to take advantage of the full succinctness offered by the new Feature class. In particular:

- LocalSubComponents and ExternallyDefined cannot be used as targets, only SubComponents.
- Measures cannot be directly varied, but must be varied by varying components with the measure attached.

Thus, if we design a sample with 0.5 uM arabinose, we can express that directly as an ExternallyDefined with 0.5 uM concentration, but if we want to express a CombinatorialDerivation in which the dosage varies between 0.0, 0.2, and 0.5 uM, we need to use a SubComponent for the variable and then create 3 Component objects, one for each dosage.

I believe this was a simple oversight in our updating, because our discussions clearly envisioned using CombinatorialDerivation in these ways. I believe this can be fixed quite simply by:

- Changing the range of VariableComponent:variable from SubComponent to Feature.
- Adding a VariableComponent:variantMeasure field, with cardinality 0..* and range om:Measure

The first change will allow modulation of all component features, which I believe is appropriate. We want to be able to change the dose of small molecules (ExternallyDefined), fill in blank variables (LocalSubComponent), vary the type of junction or scar (SequenceFeature), and might want to vary something in a subsystem (ComponentReference).

The second change will allow direct specification of variation of dosages, temperatures, and other design properties.

## 2. Specification <a name="specification"></a>
----------------------------------------------

The range of the `VariableComponent` property `variable` is changed from `SubComponent` to `Feature`.

A new `variantMeasure` property is added to `VariableComponent`, with cardinality 0..n (i.e., optional, and as many as desired can be added).

Given a set of values linked from a `VariableComponent`, it SHOULD be the case that all value are of type `Measure` or else all values are of type `Feature`.  At present, it is explicitly left undefined how an algorithm ought to handle mixtures of `Measure` and `Feature` values.

Note that because a `Measure` is not a `TopLevel`, it is not possible to link to a `variantCollection` of `Measure` objects.



## 3. Example or Use Case <a name='example'></a>
-------------------------------

In order to specify an experiment that grows a modified strain of E. coli in LB media with varying levels of L-arabinose, the following `CombinatorialDerviation` can be used:

 - `template` is a `Component` with a three Features:
  - `SubComponent` for the E. coli strain, with a Measure for dose.
  - `SubComponent` for LB media, with a Measure for dose.
  - `ExternallyDefined` for L-arabinose, with no Measure
 - There is one `VariableComponent`, with the following contents:
  - `variable` linking to the L-arabinose `ExternallyDefined`
  - `variantMeasure` pointing to a set of measures for concentrations 0.0 uM, 0.1 uM, 0.3 uM, and 1.0 uM.

This thus encodes a set of four L-arabinose doses that can be enumerated into `Component` objects, e.g.:

  - `SubComponent` for the E. coli strain, with a Measure for dose.
  - `SubComponent` for LB media, with a Measure for dose.
  - `ExternallyDefined` for L-arabinose, a Measure of 0.3 uM


## 4. Backwards Compatibility <a name='compatibility'></a>
-----------------

All CombinatorialDerivations that are legal in SBOL 3.0 will still be legal with this SEP.  This SEP will allow the construction of CombinatorialDerivations that are prohibited by the current SBOL 3.0, however.
