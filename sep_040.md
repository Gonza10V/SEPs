## Abstract

The `Component` field `type` is currently REQUIRED to use a BioPAX term, which is limiting and does not match with the SBO terms used on Interactions and Participations and in SBOL Visual. This SEP proposes changing to SBO, following the same mapping previously used with SBOL Visual.

## 1. Rationale <a name="rationale"></a>

BioPAX gives definitions for very few classes of molecular species, whereas SBO provides a much richer and more extensible set of terms. Moreover, Interations and Participations already use SBO terms.  As a result, changing the `type` of components to recommend SBO terms rather than BioPAX terms will be both more expressive and more consistent.

In fact, SBOL Visual has already switched from BioPAX to SBO, retaining BioPAX terms as deprecated with the expectation that the SBOL data model would make the same switch with SBOL 3.0.

As such, this SEP proposes to change all BioPAX `type` values to their SBO equivalents.

## 2. Specification <a name="specification"></a>

### Specification Changes

Table 2 BioPAX terms will be changed to replace each term with its corresponding SBO term. We also do no longer need to try to distinguish whether DNA and RNA components are the "whole" sequence or only part of the sequence, which never really made sense when considering parts designed to be composable.

## 3. Examples <a name='example'></a>

No examples are needed.

## 4. Backwards Compatibility <a name='compatibility'></a>

From SBOL 2 to SBOL 3, all BioPAX terms can be directly mapped onto SBO terms

Converting backward, there is ambiguity whether SBO:0000251 should map to BioPAX:Dna or BioPAX:DnaRegion (and likewise for RNA). It can likely be resolved with the heuristic that in general DNA and RNA for components should be mapped to a Region rather than a Molecule.
