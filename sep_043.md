## Abstract

In some cases, SubComponents may effectively at as local placeholders or composites that only make sense within the context of their parent component, being defined in terms of their relationships  with other SubComponents.  In this case, it may be advantageous to be able to represent the local composite without giving it a complete definition. This SEP presents a method for doing so via a new LocalSubComponent subclass of SubComponent.


## 1. Rationale <a name="rationale"></a>

We often need to create "empty" ComponentDefinitions in order to serve as placeholders in more complex ComponentDefinitions.  

For example, if you want to define a template ComponentDefinition capturing a design pattern or a library design, each ComponentInstance that serves as a variable must be associated with a full ComponentDefinition, even if that ComponentDefinition carries no information.

The same thing happens with composites that happen only within a larger system, such as stitching a promoter and CDS together in a plasmid.  The plasmid may exist only within this composition in the larger Component, but is still required to have a full ComponentDefinition.

The thing that unifies these cirucmstances is that we know that the SubComponent really has no meaningful existence outside of its use as a child with its parent Component.  For such circumstances, rather than creating a SubComponent that points to an "empty" definition Component, why not make the intention explicit by creating a LocalSubComponent that is guaranteed to be nothing but a placeholder.


## 2. Specification <a name="specification"></a>

In harmony with SEP 036 and SEP 037, the new `LocalSubComponent` class is taken to be a sibling class of `ComponentInstance`, below the new unifying `SubComponent` class.

![examples](images/sep_043_classes.png)

Per SEP 036 and SEP 037, the class diagram below `ComponentInstance` is left untouched, as this SEP leaves resolution of the merger of `ComponentDefinition` and `ModuleDefinition` to SEP 025 and SEP 010.

The `LocalSubComponent` class has only the following two fields:
- The `types` and `roles` fields are identical to their use in `ComponentDefinition`


## 3. Examples <a name='example'></a>

### Placeholders in a Template

Consider a component used for describing a library of cassettes with variable ribosome entry sites.  Its members are:

* ComponentInstance: promoter, with definition of BioBrick J23101, an Anderson library promoter.
* LocalSubComponent: RES, with type: DNA and role: SO:0000139 - Ribosome Entry Site
* ComponentInstance: CDS, with definition of BioBrick E0040 - GFPmut3 
* ComponentInstance: terminator, with definition of BioBrick B0015 - double terminator
* SequenceConstraints: promoter -> RES --> CDS --> terminator


### Composite Receiver

This system is comprised by combining two Components, and assumes adoption of SEP 037 (ComponentReferences) and SEP 041 (explicit locations).

The first is an AHL sender/receiver system, with no information about comparments:

* SubComponent: J23101-LuxI
* SubComponent: LuxI (enzyme)
* SubComponent: AHL (small molecule)
* SubComponent: LuxR (protein)
* SubComponent: Receiver, comprising tetR-RES-LuxR-terminator-pLux
* Interaction: J23101-LuxI produces LuxI enzyme
* Interaction: LuxI enzyme stimulates AHL
* Interaction: AHL + LuxR stimulates pLux

The second is a GFP reporter:

* SubComponent: GFP CDS
* SubComponent: GFP protein
* Interaction: GFP CDS produces GFP protein

These are combined into a system with the sender and receiver split across two cell lines, and in which pLux is joined to GFP: 

* SubComponent: AHL sender/receiver
* SubComponent: GFP reporter
* SubComponent: Cell-Type-1
* SubComponent: Cell-Type-2
* Interaction: Cell-Type-1 contains (reference: J23101-LuxI in AHL sender/receiver)
* Interaction: Cell-Type-1 container (reference: LuxI in AHL sender/receiver)
* Interaction: Cell-Type-1 container (reference: LuxI in AHL sender/receiver)
* SequenceConstraint: (reference: tetR-RES-LuxR-terminator-pLux in AHL sender/receiver) precedes (reference: GFP CDS in GFP reporter)
* LocalSubComponent: Cell-2-DNA**
* Interaction: Cell-Type-2 contains Cell-2-DNA
* Interaction: Cell-2-DNA contains (reference: GFP CDS in GFP reporter)
* Interaction: Cell-2-DNA contains (reference: tetR-RES-LuxR-terminator-pLux in AHL sender/receiver)

In this way, the LocalSubComponent is used to represent the fused piece of DNA that is placed within the second line of cells. If the Sequence is computed, this is where it would be attached with a Location as well (per SEP 041).

## 4. Backwards Compatibility <a name='compatibility'></a>

There is a bidirectional mapping from SBOL 2 to SBOL 3:

From SBOL 2 to SBOL 3: LocalSubComponent is not necessary, so no conversion is technically needed. As an post-convertion optimization, however, and ComponentInstance whose definition has no content other than its types and rules may be converted into a LocalSubComponent.


From SBOL 3 to SBOL 2, any LocalSubComponent can be converted into a Component or FunctionalComponent (depending on context) whose definition is a new ComponentDefinition carrying its types and roles.



## 5. Discussion <a name='discussion'></a>

A potential alternative implementation is to make the `definition` field of ComponentInstance optional.  This would avoid adding a new class, but prevent distinguishing between a SubComponent with a missing definition (an error) and a SubComponent that is intentionally not provided with a definition.

## 6. Relation to Other SEPs <a name="seps"></a>

This SEP assumes that SEP 025 will be adopted, merging ComponentDefinition and ModuleDefinition into Component.

This SEP is quite similar to and compatible with SEP 036 and SEP 036, and similarly assumes the transformation of SubComponent into a superclass of ComponentInstance.
