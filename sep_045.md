## Abstract

The `precedes` relationship covers only one of the seven basic relationships of standard interval algebra. This SEP proposes to add the other six (along with some key unions) and to clarify the definition of `precedes`.


## 1. Rationale <a name="rationale"></a>

The `precedes` relationship is valuable for ordering items in a sequence, but there are other relationships that we may wish to express as well, such as one sequence being contained within another (e.g., an intron in an RNA transcript) or one sequence overlapping with another (e.g., oligos in an assembly plan).

The standard reference for such relations is Allen's interval algebra [1]. Although designed for reasoning about time, it is applicable to any asymmetric linear sequence, including nucleic acid and amino acid sequences.

Allen's interval algebra provides 7 basic relationships, of which `precedes` is one.  These can also be joined together in unions to specify a number of additional possibilities, some of which are more likely than others to be relevant restrictions for describing biological designs.

Finally, the current definition of `precedes` is ambiguous, not defining whether the ordering relates to the beginnings or ends of intervals, and so this needs to be cleaned up as well.

## 2. Specification <a name="specification"></a>

In the table of recommended restrictions for `SequenceConstraint`, the entry for `http://sbols.org/v2#precedes` will be replaced by the following:

Restriction URI       | Description
----------------------|--------------http://sbols.org/v2#precedes      | The start of the location for `subject` is less than the start of the location for `object` (i.e., union of `strictlyPrecedes`, `meets`, and `overlaps`).  *Example: a promoter precedes a ribosome entry site, but the exact boundary between the two will be determined by sequence optimization and assembly planning.*
http://sbols.org/v2#strictlyPrecedes      | The end of the location for `subject` is less than the start of the location for `object`.  *Example: a promoter strictly precedes a terminator (with a CDS between them).*
http://sbols.org/v2#meets      | The end of the location for `subject` is equal to the start of the location for `object`. *Example: the 3' region adjacent to a blunt restriction site meets the 5' region adjacent to the site.*
http://sbols.org/v2#overlaps      | The start of the location for `subject` is before the start of the location for `object` and the end of the location for `subject` is before the end of the location for `object`. *Example: two oligos in a Gibson assembly plan*
http://sbols.org/v2#contains      | The start of the location for `subject` is less than or equal to the start of the location for `object` and the end of the location for `subject` is greater than or equal to the end of the location for `object` (i.e., union of `strictlyContains`, `equals`, `finishes`, and `starts`).  *Example: a composite part contains a promoter*
http://sbols.org/v2#strictlyContains      | The start of the location for `subject` is before the start of the location for `object` and the end of the location for `subject` is after the end of the location for `object`.  *Example: an RNA transcript strictly contains an intron.*
http://sbols.org/v2#equals      | The start and end of the location for `subject` are equal to the start and end of the location for `object`. *Example: the transcribed region of a CDS part equals the entire part.*
http://sbols.org/v2#finishes      | The start of the location for `subject` is after the start of the location for `object` and the end of the location for `subject` is equal to the end of the location for `object`. *Example: a terminator finishes an expression cassette.*
http://sbols.org/v2#starts      | The start of the location for `subject` is equal to the start of the location for `object` and the end of the location for `subject` is before the end of the location for `object`. *Example: a promoter starts an expression cassette.*

Note that here we name the Allen relations `precedes` as `strictlyPrecedes` and `contains` as `strictlyContains`, leaving the more intuitive names for the unions.

## 3. Examples <a name='example'></a>

See examples embedded in table.

## 4. Backwards Compatibility <a name='compatibility'></a>

No conversion is needed, as the SBOL 2 relations are still valid in SBOL 3 and the additional relations are allowed in SBOL 2.

Note, however, that some algorithms designed for SBOL 2 may have been using precedes incorrectly, and this may cause bugs of that type to come to light.


## 5. Discussion <a name='discussion'></a>

A number of relation names are shared between this SEP and the topological restrictions in SEP 044.  This need not be problematic, but if it is judged to be so, one or the other can have a prefix added to differentiate them.

## 6. Relation to Other SEPs <a name="seps"></a>

If SEP 037 passes, `SequenceConstraint` will be renamede to `Constraint`.

As noted above, some of the relation names in this SEP are identical to relation names in SEP 044.  If both SEP 044 and SEP 037 pass, the descriptions of the shared terms will be merged with an explanation of how they apply to ordered vs. unordered elements.
