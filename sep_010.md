Abstract
-----------

There are two very different types of 'part annotation'. (1) part composition relationships -- These always point to an existing (and presumably re-usable) sub-component. Sequence location or indeed sequence information may or may not be available. (2) Classic sequence feature annotations -- As known from the genbank format, these only apply to clearly specified sequence regions but often do not point to meaningful sub-parts.

Currently, `Component` alone is sufficient to describe sub-part relations without any sequence information. This however is the exception in synthetic biology practice. Both `SequenceAnnotation` and `Component` are needed for SBOL encoding of actual genetic designs with parts and sub-parts (because `Component` lacks a `location` field). Conversely, simple sequence features can be described using `SequenceAnnotation` alone (as of SBOL 2.0) but this possibility is not widely known and additional `Component` and `ComponentDefinition` are often created instead. 

We propose to modify `Component` and `SequenceAnnotation` such that `Component` is solely responsible for the description of part - subpart relationships (with or without sequence) and `SequenceAnnotation` is solely responsible for the description of genbank-style sequence features. `SequenceAnnotation` should be renamed to `SequenceFeature`.

**1. Rationale <a name="rationale"></a>**
----------------

### 1.1 current situation

The current `SequenceAnnotation` class has a dual purpose:

(1) Its primary role is to specify the location of "sub-parts" within the sequence of a parent ComponentDefinition. To this end, `SequenceAnnotation` links one or more `Location` records with a `Component`. The `Component`, in turn, refers to a `ComponentDefinition` (via its `definition` field). This `ComponentDefinition` is the description of the actual sub-part. Actual physical composition is therefore defined like this:

`ComponentDefinition` -[`sequenceAnnotation`]-> `SequenceAnnotation` -[`component`]-> `Component` -[`definition`]-> `ComponentDefinition`

The directionality (which one is parent and which one is a sub-part) is frequently confused. Moreover, the parent `ComponentDefinition` also directly links to the sub-part `Component` via a `component` field. This is necessary so that composition can be described before any sequences (and thus sequence locations) are known. An additional chain of references is therefore needed, in parallel to the one shown above:

`ComponentDefintion` -[`component`]-> `Component` -[`definition`]-> `ComponentDefinition`

Current SBOL 2.1 part - subpart relations are summarized in the following figure:
![SBOL 2.1 part - subpart relations][img component]

Adding to this redundancy, both `Component` and `SequenceAnnotation` may have `role` properties that diverge from the `role` (functional classification) of the target `ComponentDefinition`. Whether a diverging `role` is attached to `Component` or `SequenceAnnotation` is an arbitrary choice. This invites conflicting implementations and interpretations of this field. 

Evidently, SBOL makes the description of "undefined", "loose bag", part composition without any sequence information relatively easy. By contrast, the description of actual genetic designs with actual sequences is surprisingly complex and redundant. This is unfortunate because the latter is, by and far, the overwhelming use case of SBOL. It also hinders adoption by sequence-level designers and tool developers. 

(2) The secondary role of `SequenceAnnotation` is to simply annotate regions of interest within a given sequence. Arguably, this should be its primary role (hence the name) as it is a very common use case in practice. A `SequenceAnnotation` without `component` **can** be created and linked to a region of, e.g., DNA. `SequenceAnnotation` inherits `name` and `description` fields from `Identified` and is therefore sufficient for the description of "flat" sequence features. In practice however, most tools mix `SequenceAnnotation` and `Component` even for simple sequence features:

### 1.2 Goals of the proposal

![proposed simplified data model][data model]

(1) Restrict the use of `SequenceAnnotation` to annotations of features which do not fall into the part - subpart category. As a welcome side effect, this should make it much easier to move back and forth between SBOL and large bodies of existing genbank-formatted information and related software.

(2) Simplify the part-subpart relationship via `Component` so that it does not any longer require `SequenceAnnotation`.

(3) Create a syntactic parallel between sequence/physical and functional part-subpart relations in SBOL -- The `Component` class will be equivalent in syntax and meaning to the existing `Participation` class. For programmers, the pattern `ComponentDefinition -> Component(role) -> ComponentDefinition` will look and feel like the already established pattern `Interaction -> Participation(role) -> ComponentDefinition`. 

(4) Remove ambiguity as to how things can / should be expressed at the sequence layer to aid meaningful data exchange. 


**2. Specification <a name="specification"></a>**
----------------------------------------------

### 2.1 Add `location` field to `Component`

Add the following *optional* field to `Component`:

  * [0..n] `location` pointing to a `Location` on the *parent* `ComponentDefinition` sequence; if `location` is missing, this indicates a part / sub-part relationship for which sequence details have not (yet) been determined.

The `Location` record(s) specified by a `Component` are subject to the same restrictions currently in place for `SequenceAnnotation` `Location`. Concretely, two `Location` records attached to the same `Component` MUST NOT overlap in their range as it would not be clear what that means. The `Location` of two separate `Components` may overlap.

### 2.2 Rename `SequenceAnnotation` to `SequenceFeature`

  * rename class `SequenceAnnotation` to `SequenceFeature`
  * rename `sequenceAnnotation` field of `ComponentDefinition` to `sequenceFeature`
  
### 2.3 Restrict `SequenceFeature` to sequence feature annotation

Remove the following fields from `SequenceFeature` (formerly `SequenceAnnotation`):

  * `component` -- SequenceAnnotation is not any longer used for part - subpart relations
  * `roleIntegration` -- there is no sub-part/definition that `role` fields may be in conflict with

Update the specification to clarify usage of existing fields:

  * [0..n] `role` pointing to a SequenceOntology term (optional), corresponds to genbank type field
  * [0..1] `name` corresponding to genbank name field (optional but now RECOMMENDED)
  * [0..1] `description` corresponds to genbank description field (optional)

Moreover, a *validation rule* is needed: `SequenceFeature` can only be used
if an actual sequence record is specified for the parent `ComponentDefinition`.

### 2.3 Let `SequenceConstraint` point to `SequenceFeature`

`SequenceConstraint.object` and `SequenceConstraint.subject` can point to either `ComponentInstance` derivatives
(as before) **or** to `SequenceFeature`.

This change allows to anchor constraints on sequence regions that are not
actually sub-parts. Examples may be start / stop codons, transcription start
sites or specific mutations.


**3. Example or Use Case <a name='example'></a>**
-------------------------------

Example use cases for the modified SequenceAnnotation are feature annotations such as START or STOP codons, mutations, highlighting regions referred to in a paper, sequence conflicts, etc, all mainly intended for human consumption. Over the evolution of a design, sequence features may later be formalized into re-usable subparts (i.e. 'Component's) It is therefore conceivable that a sequence editor reads in a genbank file with many sequence features and offers the user the easy conversion of some of those features into sub-parts. This, in fact, is a workflow already used and supported by the Benchling Sequence editor (http://benchling.com).


**4. Backwards Compatibility <a name='compatibility'></a>**
-----------------

### 4.1 suggested transition path

Implement all changes at once in SBOL v 3.0.

### 4.2 Conversion of SBOL 2.x records to 3.0:

  1. remove intermediate `SequenceAnnotation` and move `SequenceAnnotation.location` to `Component`
  2. optionally, try to flatten `SequenceAnnotation` - `Component` - `ComponentDefinition` chains of trivial annotations into `SequenceFeature` records

### 4.3 Backwards conversion of SBOL 3.x to 2.x:

  * conversion of localized `Component`:
  
     (1) create `SequenceAnnotation` record pointing to subpart `Component`

     (2) move `location` from `Component` to `SequenceAnnotation`

  * conversion of non-localized `Component`:
  
     no change required

  * conversion of `SequenceFeature`
  
     (1) rename `SequenceFeature` to `SequenceAnnotation`

     (2) rename `ComponentDefinition.sequenceFeature` field to `sequenceAnnotation`


**5. Discussion <a name='discussion'></a>**
-----------------

### 5.1 author comments

As an added benefit, the proposed change creates a symmetry between the sequence
and the functional layer of SBOL: `Component` is now the equivalent of
`Participation`. The former describes a physical part- subpart relation whereas
the latter describes a functional part - subpart relation. Both specify one or
more `role` properties, both point to a (sub)`ComponentDefinition`. Currently,
this parallel is obfuscated by the multiple direct and indirect references
between parent and sub-part `ComponentDefinition`.

### 5.2 discussion at COMBINE

  * It was pointed out that `SequenceAnnotation` already can have its own `name` and `description` fields as it is derrived from `Identified`. The SEP was changed accordingly.
  * Renaming `SequenceAnnotation` to `SequenceFeature` was universally considered a good idea (for symmetry with genbank, bioinformatics practics and in order to avoid confusion with "Annotation" in SBOL and SBML).

### 5.3 SequenceConstraints

  * At COMBINE, it was suggested that `SequenceConstraint` should also be allowed to point to `SequenceFeature`. This would avoid construction of `Component` - `ComponentDefinition` chains for, e.g. mutations or other simple features that are not sub-parts but nevertheless restrict/orient the positioning of other Components. This change has been incorporated into the SEP.

  * Originally, this link `SequenceConstraint` -> `SequenceFeature` link was restricted to the `SequenceConstraint.object` field. This was meant to enforce that `Components` (sub-parts) can be anchored to sequence features but not the other way round. However, the types of constraints allowed assume that the directionality of a `SequenceConstraint` can be freely chosen. We can say that part A `preceeds` part B but we cannot say that part A "follows" part B. In SBOL, the latter is expressed as "part B `preceeds` part A" (i.e. `subject` and `object` of the `SequenceConstrain` are reversed). For this reason, both `object` and `subject` of the constraint need to be allowed pointing to `SequenceFeature`.

  * At COMBINE, it was suggested to rename `SequenceConstraint` into `ComponentConstraint` -- this should be put into a separate SEP.
 
  * It was suggested to put additional restrictions on the use of `Component.location` so that a fully specified sequence can more easily be pieced together from Component sequences. This raises an important issue with the current data model, which does not allow an easy distinction between partially defined and fully specified sequences. However, the editors consider this as an orthogonal problem which should be adressed separately.
 
### 5.4 Transition path

 * The original SEP (see github history) suggested a step-wise introduction starting with SBOL 2.2. This would have led to a hybrid data model where both usage patterns could co-exist and was eventually considered too complex. Instead, the SEP is considered as a clean backward-incompatible change for SBOL v 3.0.

### 5.5 Related SEPs

The following SEPs make complementary suggestions for further simplification of the SBOL data model:

* [SEP 15](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SEPs/blob/master/sep_015.md) [(Issue)](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SEPs/issues/32) -- rename Component -> SubPart and ComponentDefinition -> Component
* [SEP 25](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SEPs/blob/master/sep_025.md)  [(Issue)](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SEPs/issues/58) -- merge Module(Definition) with Component(Definition) and remove FunctionalComponent
