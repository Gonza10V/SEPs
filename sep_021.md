Abstract
-----------

Linking experimental data to samples and genetic designs is becoming critical to many synthetic biology projects, including the DARPA program Synergistic Discovery and Design (SD2).

Rationale <a name="rationale"></a>
----------------

* Queries for experimental results will benefit from grouping `Attachment` objects with classes like `Experiment` and `ExperimentalData` that are more domain-specific than `Collection`.
* We will eventually want a class like `ExperimentalData` that can be extended with indices into experimental data files and linked to experimental conditions.
* We will eventually want a class like `Experiment` that can be linked to an experimental design that includes experimental factors, levels, conditions, etc.

Specification <a name="specification"></a>
----------------------------------------------

Here we propose to add two new classes, `Experiment` and `ExperimentalData`, to enable users to group links to experimental data files (`Attachment` objects) in a more domain-specific manner than using the SBOL `Collection` class.

Accordingly, we also propose to modify the relevant best-practice validation rules for specifying provenance relationships between objects in a design-build-test-learn cycle.

### 2.1 Experiment <a name="exp"></a>

The `Experiment` class represents a set of experimental results that were collected in accordance with some experimental design (currently not specified by this class).

#### 2.1.1 Experiment.experimentalData <a name="exp_expData"></a>

The `experimentalData` property is OPTIONAL and MAY contain zero or more URIs that refer to `ExperimentalData` objects.

### 2.2 ExperimentalData <a name="expData"></a>

The `ExperimentalData` class represents a set of links to experimental data files (`Attachment` objects) that are typically but not always associated with a single sample, experimental condition, and/or lab instrument.

### 2.3 Modified Validation Rules for Design-Build-Test-Learn Cycles <a name="validation_rules"></a>

* sbol-12506 should be changed from

"A `Usage` that has a `roles` property that contains the URI http://sbols.org/v2#test SHOULD refer to an `Attachment` or `Collection` of `Attachment` objects."

to

"A `Usage` that has a `roles` property that contains the URI http://sbols.org/v2#test SHOULD refer to an `ExperimentalData` object."

* sbol-10226 should be changed from

"A `Identified` with a `wasGeneratedBys` property that includes a reference to an `Activity` with a child `Association` that has a `roles` property that contains the URI http://sbols.org/v2#test SHOULD be an `Attachment` or a `Collection` of `Attachment` objects."

to

"An `Identified` with a `wasGeneratedBys` property that includes a reference to an `Activity` with a child `Association` that has a `roles` property containing the URI http://sbols.org/v2#test SHOULD be an `ExperimentalData` object."

Examples <a name='examples'></a>
-------------------------------

### 3.1 Interlab Example <a name="example2"></a>

Figure 3 shows an example `Experiment` with the results of characterizing a single IGEM part. Note that the `Experiment` object itself is not shown, just the `ExperimentalData` objects to which it refers.

![ExperimentalData class UML diagram](images/sep_021_interlab_example.png "ExperimentalData class UML diagram")

**Figure 3:** Example of an `Experiment` from the IGEM Interlab Study 

The `Experiment` includes `ExperimentalData` derived from three `Implementation` objects: a positive control, a negative control, and the study construct. These `ExperimentalData` are generated by a single characterization `Activity` associated with a flow cytometer `Agent` and plate reader `Agent`. Each `ExperimentalData` groups the `Attachment` objects linking two data files: one containing absorbance values measured with the plate reader, and one containing fluorescence values measured with the flow cytometer.

Note that this example does not include sufficient detail to explicitly determine which lab instrument `Agent` is associated with which `Attachment`. To enable this determination, one could instead specify one characterization `Activity` per `Agent` and one `ExperimentalData` per `Attachment`, and then link these objects accordingly.

Backwards Compatibility <a name='compatibility'></a>
-----------------

This proposal does not affect backwards compatibility.

Discussion <a name='discussion'></a>
-----------------

Relation to Other SEPs <a name='competing_seps'></a>
-----------------

This proposal revises the best-practice validation rules from SEP 019 that were recently incorporated into SBOL version 2.2.
