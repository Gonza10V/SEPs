## Abstract

Currently, information about the physical structure of a Component is dispersed across three different places: Locations hold geometric information, while Constraints and Interactions of type Containment hold topological information. This SEP proposes to unify the two types of topological information by adding a set of values for standard topological constraints.



## 1. Rationale <a name="rationale"></a>

At present, we have multiple different ways of representing the physical structure of a Component, all located in different places:

* The exact geometric location of sub-sequences for a Component within a Sequence is expressed via Locations on SubComponents or SequenceFeatures.
* The ordering of SubComponents in a linear structure is expressed with the constraint property of a Component.
* The topological containment of one SubComponent within another is expressed with an Interaction of type containment (SBO:0000469).

Following the adoption of SEP 025, both types of topological information are within the same Component class, so there is no reason to continue to keep them separated. Accordingly, this SEP proposes to dispense with containment via Interactions and add a set of values for standard topological constraints.

It is also that case that while every type of Component has geometric or topological structure of interest, many do not have a linear/sequential structure, so the sequenceFeatures property would be better to rename to features, in anticipation of potential future expansion from SequenceFeature to an abstract Feature class that can annotate contextual features on objects without sequential structure.

## 2. Specification <a name="specification"></a>

### Rename Component sequenceFeature property to feature

The `sequenceFeature` property of `Component` is renamed to the more generic `feature`.

The `SequenceFeature` class is explicitly *not* renamed, as the intention is to allow future creation of an abstract `Feature` class that will cover both `SequenceFeature` and a number of sibling classes.

### Topological Constraint values

To the existing RECOMMENDED `restriction` values for the `Constraint` class, we add a new collection that deals with the spatial relationships of physical objects in general, rather than the special case of directional linear sequences.

These values are based on the set of eight possible topological relationships between two spatial regions without holes [1].
Of these, we derive a set of seven restrictions:

* Two relationships are omitted as redundant: `inside` and `coveredBy` are respectively equivalent to `strictlyContains` and `covers` with `subject` and `object` swapped.
* We include a common union relationship, `contains`, meaning either `strictlyContains` or `covers`.
* The symmetric `equal` relationship is changed to an asymmetric `replaces` relationship, allowing resolution of potentially conflicting definitions.



Restriction URI       | Description
----------------------|--------------http://sbols.org/v2#disjoint      | `subject` and `object` do not overlap in space.  *Example: a plasmid is disjoint from a chromosome.*
http://sbols.org/v2#strictlyContains      | `subject` entirely contains `object`: they do not share a boundary.  *Example: a cell contains a plasmid*
http://sbols.org/v2#contains      | `subject` contains `object` and they might or might not share a boundary.  *Example: a cell contains a protein that may or may not bind to its membrane.*
http://sbols.org/v2#replaces      | `subject` and `object` occupy the same in space, . *Example: the J23101 promoter replaces a generic promoter*
http://sbols.org/v2#meets      | `subject` and `object` are connected at a shared boundary. *Example: two strains of adherent cells meet at their membranes*
http://sbols.org/v2#covers      | `subject` contains `object` but also shares a boundary. *Example: a cell covers its transmembrane proteins.*
http://sbols.org/v2#overlaps      | `subject` and `object` overlap in space, but portions of each are outside of the other. *Example: a transmembrane protein overlaps the cell membrane*

Note that in most cases, `disjoint` is the expected default and does not need to be explicitly expressed.

### Non-Recommendation of Containment Interaction

SEP 030 recommends using an `Interaction` of type `containment` (SBO:0000469) to represent topological containment. Introduction of the new constraint values renders this obsolete, so this recommentation will be deleted.

The optional use of a `physical compartment` (SBO:0000290) role to explicitly specify where an `Interaction` is taking place, however, is still valid.


## 3. Examples <a name='example'></a>

See above examples in the table of restrictions. 

## 4. Backwards Compatibility <a name='compatibility'></a>

No conversion is strictly needed, as the SBOL 2 relations are still valid in SBOL 3 and the additional relations are allowed in SBOL 2.

However, as a recommended practice, any `Interaction` of type `containment` SHOULD be changed to a set of  `Constraint` objects with restriction `contains`, one for each pair of `Participant` objects with roles `physical compartment` (mapping to `subject`) and `contained` (mapping to `object`).



## 5. Discussion <a name='discussion'></a>

An enhancement to consider is that `Location` might be renamed to `SequenceLocation` since the Location class describes only locations on Sequence objects, not other types of geometric locations.  We do not yet have a second type of location information proposed, however, so it is not clear whether this would be useful.

It is also an interesting question whether an analogous transformation or should be made to the `location` and `sourceLocation` properties of `ComponentInstance`.  Right now, these only refer to sequences, which makes them dubious, but if `Location` becomes generalized, then it would be good to keep these properties just as they are.

Previously, this SEP recommended creating a separate class for topological constraints and merging the classes under a new abstract superclass. Since SequenceConstraint is being generalized to Constraint by SEP 037, however, this was judged in discussion to be introducing complexity without value and discarded.

## 6. Relation to Other SEPs <a name="seps"></a>

This SEP is written taking into account the adoption of SEP 025, merging `ComponentDefinition` and `ModuleDefinition` into `Component`, and SEP 010, renaming `SequenceAnnotation` to `SequenceFeature`.

This SEP assumes that SEP 037 will be adopted, renaming `SequenceConstraint` to `Constraint`.

Some of the constraint names here overlap with SEP 045. If both are adopted, then their descriptions will be merged, clarifying how they are to be interpreted in ordered vs. non-ordered objects.
