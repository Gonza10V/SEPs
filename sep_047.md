Abstract
-----------
SBOL 3.0 set up Namespace to point to objects, which will tend to make Namespace objects extremely large. Instead, objects should point to their Namespace. This SEP proposes to reverse the direction of the relationship.

## 1. Rationale <a name="rationale"></a>
----------------
In SBOL 3.0, we introduced the concept of a Namespace, which facilitates URI rewriting. During implementation, we realized that it would be useful to make the relationship between a Namespace and an TopLevel object in that Namespace explicit.

As the concept is having TopLevels in Namespaces, we implemented this by having Namespace be a subclass of Collection, with its members being an inventory of the TopLevels in the namespace.

Pragmatically, however, this was a mistake. This will make Namespace objects very large and require them to be updated whenever a new object is added to the Namespace. It will also make it impossible to directly verify if an object is assigned to a Namespace or not, as an object can be created without reference in a Namespace.

This can be readily amended by changing the membership to point the other way, with Namespace just being a placeholder TopLevel, and every TopLevel being required to point to a Namespace.  

Notes:

 - There will be no additional storage cost for this proposal: a link between Namespace and TopLevel will still require precisely one triple.  The only difference is how this triple is conceived of in relationship to objects.

 - A potential alternative would be to put the link on Identified instead of TopLevel.  All Identified objects that are not TopLevel objects, however, are child objects, which are already required to inherit their Namespace from their parent. Thus, putting the link to Namespace on Identified would be redundant.

## 2. Specification <a name="specification"></a>
----------------------------------------------

### Change to Namespace

The Namespace object will no longer be a subclass of Collection. Instead, it will be a subclass of TopLevel, with no members property.

### Change to TopLevel

The TopLevel object will have a new `namespace` property that is REQUIRED and points to a Namespace object.


## 3. Example or Use Case <a name='example'></a>
-------------------------------


## 4. Backwards Compatibility <a name='compatibility'></a>
-----------------

This is _not_ backward compatible with the current state of SBOL 3.0, and thus needs to be adopted before the first SBOL 3 implementations are complete.
