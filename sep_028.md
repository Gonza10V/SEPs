Abstract
-----------

This SEP recommends the use of classes from the [Ontology of Units of Measure (OM)](http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/resource/om-2) to represent measurements/parameters and their associated units. This SEP also proposes adding a new OPTIONAL `measure` property to relevant classes in the SBOL data model, including `Interaction`, `Participation`, `FunctionalComponent`, and `Module`.

## 1. Rationale <a name="rationale"></a>
----------------

There are currently several use cases that warrant the inclusion of measurements/parameters and their associated units. These use cases include specification of genetic circuit designs and environmental conditions. In the first case, there is a need to specify the basic parameters of a genetic circuit (such as in a data sheet) to permit the generation of fully-fledged models of circuit behavior. In the second use case, there is a need to specify concentrations and other measures of environmental factors such as growth media that are conducive to design function or characteristic of an experimental condition.


## 2. Specification <a name="specification"></a>
----------------------------------------------

### 2.1 Measurements/Parameters<a name="measurements"></a>

Numerical measurements and parameters SHOULD be specified as members of the `Measure`, `Unit`, and `Prefix` classes from the [Ontology of Units of Measure (OM)](http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/resource/om-2). As incorporated into the SBOL data model, `Measure` is a subclass of `Identified`, while `Unit` and `Prefix` are subclasses of `TopLevel` (Figure 1).

**Figure 1:** Diagram of the `Measure`, `Unit`, and `Prefix` classes and their associated properties.

#### 2.1.1 Measure<a name="measure"></a>

The purpose of the `Measure` class is to link a numerical value to a unit of measure. The `hasNumericalValue` property is REQUIRED and MUST contain a single xsd:float. Its `hasUnit` propery is also REQUIRED and MUST contain a single URI that refers to a member of the `Unit` class. Typically this URI will refer to a specific `Unit` that is already documented by OM, such as "gram per liter", but it can also refer to a custom `Unit` that is not covered by OM but is still useful for synthetic biology, such as "molecules of equivalent fluorescein", or "MEFL" for short. Finally, the `types` property is OPTIONAL and MAY contain a set of URIs. It is RECOMMENDED that these URIs identify terms from the [Systems Biology Ontology (SBO)](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/sbo/main/). Note that this `types` property is added by SBOL and is not native to OM.

#### 2.1.2 Unit<a name="unit"></a>

The purpose of the `Unit` class is to describe a particular unit of measure. The `symbol` property is REQUIRED and MUST contain a String. This String is commonly used to abbreviate the unit of measure's `name`. For example, the unit of measure named "gram per liter" is commonly abbreviated using the String "g/l". Alternative abbreviations can be specified using the `alternativeSymbols` property, which is OPTIONAL and MAY contain zero or more Strings. Similarly, alternative common names can be specified using the `alternativeLabels` property, which is OPTIONAL and MAY contain zero or more Strings. Finally, the `longcomment` property is OPTIONAL and MAY contain a String. A long comment is an alternative description that is expected to be, well, long.

Since the `Unit` class is abstract, specific units of measure are represented as instances of its subclasses: `SingularUnit`, `PrefixedUnit`, `UnitMultiplication`, `UnitDivision`, and `UnitExponentiation`.

The `SingularUnit` class is used to describe a unit of measure that is not explicitly represented as a multiplication, division, or exponentiation of two or more units, but could be equivalent to such a representation. For example, joule is considered a `SingularUnit`, but it is equivalent to the multiplication of a newton and a meter. The 'hasFactor' property of the `SingularUnit` class is OPTIONAL and MAY contain a xsd:float. The `hasUnit` property is also OPTIONAL and MAY contain a single URI that refers to another member of the `Unit` class. These properties can be used in conjunction to specify whether a `SingularUnit` is defined as another `Unit` multiplied by some factor. For example, an angstrom is defined as 10<sup>-10</sup> meters. If the `hasFactor` property of a `SingularUnit` is non-empty, then its `hasUnit` property SHOULD also be non-empty.

The `PrefixedUnit` class used to desribe a unit of measure that is explicitly represented as the product of some factor and another `Unit`. Similar to the `SingularUnit` class, the `PrefixedUnit` class includes a `hasUnit` property, but this property is REQUIRED rather than OPTIONAL. Instead of a `hasFactor` property, the `PrefixedUnit` class includes a REQUIRED `hasPrefix` property that MUST contain a single URI that refers to a member of the `Prefix` class (a standard factor).

The `UnitMultiplication` class is used to describe a unit of measure that is the multiplication of two other units of measure. The `hasTerm1` and `hasTerm2` properties are both REQUIRED and MUST each contain a single URI that refers to a member of the `Unit` class. Next, the `UnitExponentiation` class is used to describe a unit of measure that is the exponentiation of one unit of measure by another. The `hasBase` and `hasExponent` properties are both REQUIRED and MUST each contain a single URI that refers to a member of the `Unit` class. Finally, the `UnitDivision` class is used to describe a unit of measure that is the division of one unit of measure by another. The `hasNumerator` and `hasDenominator` properties are both REQUIRED and MUST each contain a single URI that refers to a member of the `Unit` class.

#### 2.1.3 Prefix<a name="prefix"></a>

The purpose of the `Prefix` class is to describe a standard factor for defining a `Unit` in terms of a multiplication of said factor and another `Unit`. For example, a milligram is defined as the multiplication of a gram and the standard factor 10<sup>-3</sup> (milli). The `hasFactor` property is REQUIRED and MUST contain an xsd:float. Much like the `Unit` class, the `Prefix` class also has a  `symbol` property that is REQUIRED and MUST contain a String. This String is commonly used to abbreviate the prefix's `name`. For example, the prefix named "milli" is commonly abbreviated using the String "m". Alternative abbreviations can be specified using the `alternativeSymbols` property, which is OPTIONAL and MAY contain zero or more Strings. Similarly, alternative common names can be specified using the `alternativeLabels` property, which is OPTIONAL and MAY contain zero or more Strings. Finally, the `longcomment` property is OPTIONAL and MAY contain a String.

### 2.2 SBOL Class Extensions<a name="sbol_extension"></a>

In order for relevant SBOL classes to be linked to parameters or measurements and their associated units, we propose adding an OPTIONAL `measures` property to the `FunctionalComponent`, `Module`, `Interaction`, and `Participation` classes. This property MAY specify a set of `Measure` objects contained by the parent. For example, an `Interaction` that represents a chemical reaction may have parameters added to it and each `Participation` it contains to capture its chemical kinetic rate and the stoichiometries of its reactants and products. A `ModuleDefinition` that represents growth media recipe may have measures added to each `FunctionalComponent` "ingredient" it contains and/or each `Module` "sub-media" that it includes.

## 3. Example or Use Case <a name='example'></a>
-------------------------------

Figure 2 shows an example of using instances of the `Measure` and `Unit` classes in conjunction with instances of the SBOL `ModuleDefinition` and `ComponentDefinition` classes to specify a growth medium recipe. Note that this specification for M9 Glucose CAA media is partly composed from the specification of another growth medium, Teknova M1902. Namespace abbreviations used in this example include `om` for `http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/resource/om-2/`, `obo` for `http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/`, `chebi` for `http://identifiers.org/chebi/`, and `sbo` for `http://identifiers.org/biomodels.sbo/`. C85504 codes for the term "growth medium" in the National Cancer Institute Thesaurus (NCIT). For specifying `Measure` `types` with SBO, 0000196 codes for "concentration of an entity pool", 0000226 codes for "density of an entity pool", and 0000470 codes for "mass fraction."
