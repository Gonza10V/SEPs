Rationale <a name="rationale"></a>
----------
To specify a general container for a file attachment including metadata that helps tools interpret the file

Specification <a name="specification"></a>
-------------

### 2.1 Attachment <a name="attach"></a>

The `Attachment` class is a general container for data files, especially experimental data files. `Attachment` is a `TopLevel` object, and any other `TopLevel` object can refer to a list of `attachments`. `Attachment` has the following properties:

#### 2.1.1  Source <a name="source"></a>

The source is a link to the external file and is REQUIRED.

#### 2.1.2 Format <a name="format"></a>

The format is an ontology term indicating the format of the file. It is RECOMMENDED to use the EDAM ontology for file formats, which includes a variety of experimental data formats. The `format` is an OPTIONAL field

#### 2.1.3 Size <a name="size"></a>

The size is a long integer indicating the file size in bytes. This may be used by client applications accessing files over RESTful APIs. This field is OPTIONAL.

#### 2.1.4 Hash <a name="hash"></a>

The hash is a string used to retrieve files from a cache. This field is OPTIONAL.

Examples <a name="examples"></a>
-------

### 3.1 Attachment <a name="example5"></a>

![Attachment example](images/sep_018_attachment_example.png "Attachment example")

**Example 1:** `Attachments` wrap an experimental data file and include important meta-data that helps tools interpret the data. This example attaches quality control data in the form of a gel image and sequencing results.

Backwards Compatibility <a name="compatability"></a>
-----------------------
This proposal does not affect backwards compatibility.

Discussion <a name="discussion"></a>
----------
This proposal has been discussed extensively at HARMONY 2017 and on the Github issue tracker. There is general consensus that an `Attachment` is needed.  

<!--- Some have proposed that any `TopLevel` object should be able to link an `Attachment`, but a concern raised with this approach is that it becomes difficult for developers to interpret when and where the `Attachment` should be added. Therefore this proposal specifies that only `Collections` may link to `Attachments`.  However, at a later date, there may be justifiable reasons to allow other core SBOL classes to link `Attachments`. --->

Relation to Other SEPs <a name="relation"></a>
----------------------
This proposal relates to SEP 019, which deals with how experimental data should be linked to SBOL as part of encoding the provenance for design-build-test-learn cycles in synthetic biology.
