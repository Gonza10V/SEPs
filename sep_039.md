Abstract
-----------

This SEP addresses some of the issues related to the naming of SBOL entities and using URIs to adopt existing Semantic Web best practices. It also recommends a fully-graph based serialisation for SBOL documents.

1. Rationale <a name="rationale"></a>
----------------

SBOL is serialised as RDF and builds upon the existing Semantic Web stack. Ideally, we should follow some of the best practices where possible for better integration with exsiting Semantic Web tools and to increase tool support.


2. Specification <a name="specification"></a>
----------------------------------------------
 
### 2.1 Differentiating SBOL entities (concepts) and properties
The SBOL data model currently has several labels that are both used to refer to entities and property names. The SBOL practice has been using the uppercase letter when referring to entities and using the lowercase letter when referring to property names. However, not all tools are case sensitive. Moreover, referring to the data model makes it more difficult to explain in papers. It would be useful to remove this ambiguity and to make the labels unique as much as possible.  Prefixing and suffixing should be applied to property names, e.g. 'has...' or 'is...Of'

Some of the suggested changes include:
* Component entity and component property: Change component to hasComponent
* SequenceAnnotation entity and sequenceAnnotation property: Change sequenceAnnotation to hasSequenceAnnotation
* SequenceConstraint entity and sequenceConstraint property: Change sequenceConstraint to hasSequenceConstraint
* Sequence entity and sequence property: Change sequence to hasSequence

Please see [1].

### 2.2 Consistent labelling of SBOL entities
Although SBOL entities usually start with uppercase, some of the entities still start with lowercase. We suggest capitalizing all entities that are represented as RDF resources. These respources are SBOL entities or values that are represented with unique URIs. Some of the suggested changes include:
* access values should be capitalised
  * e.g. 'public' should be changed to 'Public'
  * e.g. 'private' should be changed to 'Private'
* role integration values should be capitalised
* refinement values should be capitalised
* orientation values should be capitalised
* restriction values should be capitalised

Please see [2] and [3].

### 2.3 sbol:type vs rdf:type
We suggest using rdf:type instead of sbol:type property, which is used to specify the type of an SBOL entity. SBOL entities are serialised as RDF resources. Typically, the rdf:type property is used to describe the type of RDF resources. URIs pointed by rdf:type property can further be described using part-subpart relationships and allows. These relationships are key when inferring information.

Currently, it is assumed there could be only one usage of the rdf:type property to specify the type of an SBOL entity using the SBOL data model. E.g. All ComponentDefinition entities have "entityA rdf:type  sbol:ComponentDefinition" signature where entityA is the URI of an SBOL Component Definition.

In the following example,  sbol:type has been replaced with rdf:type to indiate the type of an SBOL entity using biopax:DnaRegion.  This would allow BioPAX tools to use  SBOL data.
```
<sbol:ComponentDefinition rdf:about=“…”>
<rdf:type="biopax:DnaRegion” />
...
</sbol:ComponentDefinition>
```

In the following example,  sbol:type has been replaced with rdf:type to indiate the type of a PROV entity using sbol:Design, rather than using a custom sbol:type property for an prov:Activity that is outside the SBOL data model.
```
<prov:Activity rdf:about=“…”>
<rdf:type="sbol:Design />
</prov:Activity>
```
This graqh fragment is actually exactly same as the following, which has the emphasis for SBOL:
```
<sbol:Design rdf:about=“…”>
<rdf:type="prov:Activity />
</prov:Activity>
```

This apprach also facilitates writing more efficient and shorter queries using SBOL.

### 2.4 Fully graph-based serialisation of SBOL document
We propose using a full graph serialisation for SBOL documents using different types of graph formats such as RDF, N3 nd JSON. Graph serialisation removes the need to provide serilisation examples and the actual formatting of graphs. As long as two SBOL documents include exactly the same nodes and edges using identical URIs, these two graphs would be identical, even if the order of these nodes in files are different. Different serialisation formats such as N3 increases the readability of SBOL documents. Such documents can even be edited manually. Moreover, formats such as N3 and JSON is more lightweight for data exhange. JSON is especially useful to facilitate the development of web based applications due to JavaScript support provided by internet browsers. 



3. Example or Use Case <a name='example'></a>
-------------------------------

Examples about the RDF serialisation can be found at https://github.com/goksel/SBOLRDF/tree/master/RDFExamples.

4. Backwards Compatibility <a name='compatibility'></a>
-----------------
Not all of the proposed changes are not directly backward compatible. Graph-based serialisation of SBOL documents using RDF/XML is backward compatible. 

5. Discussion <a name='discussion'></a>
-----------------
None.

6. Competing SEPs <a name='competing_seps'></a>
-----------------

None.
