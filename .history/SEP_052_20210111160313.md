## Abstract

This document proposes some changes to the SBOL governance document at [1](https://sbolstandard.org/community-governance/), regarding the SBOL Editor term duration and the possibility of re-election.

The key changes in this document are:

- Permit the option of extending the term of an SBOL Editor for an extra year.
- Allow for the re-election of SBOL Editors for a consecutive term if there are no other nominations for the role.

## 1. Rationale <a name="rationale"></a>

Currently, SBOL Editors serve for two-year terms without the possibility of being re-elected for consecutive terms. However, this can bring some problems for the following situations:

1. Multiple SBOL Editors' terms ending roughly at the same time, which would cause a lot of .
2. 
3. No nominees are proposed for an open spot as an SBOL Editor, and current SBOL Editors cannot get nominated.

To tackle these problems, we suggest the following changes:

1. Allow for the extension of an SBOL Editor's term for an extra year, if needed. This would allow to coordinate SBOL Editor rotations so that not all the terms end at the same time. This would allow for more experienced SBOL Editors to extend their term and teach/pass on important information to newly accepted SBOL Editors.
2. If the case that there are no nominees for an open slot as an SBOL Editor role, current SBOL Editors should be allowed to run (folling the normal procedures) for the place even if it would mean the person would be serving two consecutive terms. The caveat *"**if** there are no nominees"* would ensure that there is turn-around for SBOL Editors seats if there are people volunteering for the seat. 

The "SBOL Governance Changes" section will explain the changes to the text of the governance document at [1](https://sbolstandard.org/community-governance/) that will occur if this SEP is accepted and adopted.

## 2. SBOL Governance Changes <a name="specification"></a>

If adopted, the following text:

> Editors serve for a two year term and cannot serve terms consecutively.

will be replaced with:

> Editors serve for a two-year term with the option of a third at the discretion of the editor and chair.  Editors cannot serve consecutive terms unless no other nominations are made during the nomination period.

in the governance document at [1](https://sbolstandard.org/community-governance/).
