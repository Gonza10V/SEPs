## Abstract

This document proposes some changes to the SBOL governance document at [1](https://sbolstandard.org/community-governance/), regarding the SBOL Editor term duration and the possibility of re-election.

The key changes in this document are:

- Permit the option of extending the term of an SBOL Editor for an extra year.
- Allow for the re-election of SBOL Editors for a consecutive term if there are no other nominations for the role.

## 1. Rationale <a name="rationale"></a>

Currently, SBOL Editors serve for two-year terms without the possibility of being re-elected for consecutive terms. However, this can bring some problems for the following situations:

1. Multiple SBOL Editors' terms ending roughly at the same time, which would cause a lot of .
2. No nominees are proposed for an open spot as an SBOL Editor, and current SBOL Editors cannot get nominated.

The current SBOL governance documents are rather incomplete and do not reflect the consensus state of practice in how the community is governing itself.  This SEP attempts to fill out important missing information (e.g., quorum for votes, purpose of the SBOL Chair), and also to recognize and legitimate current practices (e.g., editors are elected by a vote organized via the mailing list, not by consensus at a workshop).

The "SBOL Governance Changes" section will explain the changes to the text of the governance document at [1](https://sbolstandard.org/community-governance/) that will occur if this SEP is accepted and adopted.

## 2. SBOL Governance Changes <a name="specification"></a>

If adopted, the following text in the governance document at [1](https://sbolstandard.org/community-governance/)

> Editors serve for a two year term and cannot serve terms consecutively.

will be replaced with:

> Editors serve for a two-year term with the option of a third at the discretion of the editor and chair.  Editors cannot serve consecutive terms unless no other nominations are made during the nomination period.
